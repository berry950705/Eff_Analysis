## üöÄ Key Features

- **Data Exploration:** Trend analysis on efficiency curves (monthly/weekly) to detect anomalies.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Identify relationships between efficiency drops and main operational variables (e.g., water flow, temp diff, total kWh).
- **Root Cause Investigation:** Compare raw sensor data during normal and abnormal periods to pinpoint faulty readings.
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Deliver concrete solutions such as sensor maintenance scheduling, alarm setting improvements, and incident tracking workflow.
- **All-in-Notebook Workflow:** Analysis, visualization, and documentation are consolidated in a single Jupyter Notebook.

## üìà Analysis Process

1. **Import Data:** Load operational efficiency and sensor readings from MySQL.
2. **Trend Analysis:** Visualize efficiency over time to spot sustained drops.
3. **Correlation:** Quantify how variables (water flow, temperature diff, total kWh) relate to efficiency anomalies.
4. **Root Cause:** Deep-dive into raw data to isolate equipment or sensor malfunctions.
5. **Recommendations:** Propose concrete maintenance and alarm system improvements to prevent future issues.

## üí° Key Insights

- Sustained efficiency drops were observed in early 2024, confirmed as non-random and linked to abnormal water flow spikes.
- Outlier analysis revealed faulty sensor readings, with flow measurements exceeding normal range by up to 5x.
- Solution: Strengthen maintenance routines, enhance alarm triggers, and implement issue tracking.
